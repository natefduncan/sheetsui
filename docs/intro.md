# Intro

## Supported formats

Currently we only support the [ironcalc](https://docs.ironcalc.com/) xlsx
features for spreadsheet. I plan to handle csv import and export at some point.
I also might support other export formats as well but for the moment just csv
and it's variants such as tsv are in the roadmap.

## User Interface

The sheetui user interface is loosely inspired by vim. It is a modal interface
that is entirely keyboard driven. At nearly any time you can type `Alt-h` to
get some context sensitive help.

## Modal Docs

To get help on each modality in command mode `:` type

* `help navigate`
* `help edit`
* `help command`
* `help visual`
